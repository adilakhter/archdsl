What is archdsl? 
===============


*archdsl* is a unified _domain-specific language_ for describing software architectures. It defines software architecture declaratively and generates xADL 2.0[1] architecture specifications. It is built using *Spoofax Language Workbench*.The resulting architectures are based primarily based on the Myx Framework. However, it can be targeted to different framework as well since the xADL file format is, per se, not a framework specific description.
